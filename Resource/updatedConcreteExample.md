Now, let me explain how the score setting process works and how it can be implemented in your tournament planner system:

Flexible Score Storage:

Scores are stored as JSON strings in the Score column of the Matches table.
This allows for flexibility in storing different score formats for various game types.


Game-Specific Score Classes:

Each game type has its own score class (e.g., TableTennisScore, ChessScore) that implements the IScore interface.
These classes define the structure and rules for scores in each game type.


Score Service:

A ScoreService class handles the logic for setting scores and determining winners.
It has methods for each game type (e.g., SetTableTennisScore, SetChessScore).


Setting Scores:

When updating a match score:

The appropriate score object is created and populated with the new score data.
The score object is serialized to JSON.
The JSON string is stored in the Score column of the Matches table.




Determining Winners:

The UpdateMatchWinner method is called after setting the score.
It checks if the match is complete and determines the winner if applicable.
The winner determination logic can be game-specific, implemented using a strategy pattern or switch expression.


Controller/Application Service Usage:

The controller or application service would receive score update requests.
It creates the appropriate score object and calls the ScoreService to update the match.



Here's how you might use this in your application:
```c#
For Table Tennis:
csharpCopyvar tableTennisScore = new TableTennisScore
{
    Player1Sets = 3,
    Player2Sets = 1,
    SetScores = new List<(int, int)>
    {
        (11, 9),
        (11, 7),
        (9, 11),
        (11, 5)
    }
};
matchController.UpdateTableTennisScore(matchId, tableTennisScore);

For Chess:
csharpCopyvar chessScore = new ChessScore
{
    Result = ChessScore.ChessResult.Player1Win,
    Moves = new List<string> { "e4", "e5", "Nf3", "Nc6", "Bb5", "a6", "Ba4", "Nf6", "O-O", "Be7", "Re1", "b5", "Bb3", "d6", "c3", "O-O", "h3", "Nb8", "d4", "Nbd7" }
};
matchController.UpdateChessScore(matchId, chessScore);
```

Benefits of this approach:

Flexibility: Can easily accommodate different scoring systems for various game types.
Type Safety: Game-specific score classes ensure type safety and proper score structure.
Separation of Concerns: Score logic is encapsulated in the ScoreService, separate from controllers and data access.
Extensibility: New game types can be added by creating new score classes and extending the ScoreService.

To implement this in your system:

Create the score classes for each game type in your domain layer.
Implement the ScoreService in your application layer.
Update your controllers or application services to use the ScoreService for score updates.
Ensure your data access layer can properly serialize and deserialize the JSON scores when reading from and writing to the database.

This structure allows for a flexible and extensible way to handle scores for different game types while maintaining strong typing and separation of concerns in your application.
